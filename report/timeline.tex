\paragraph{January 2010}
Found announcement for the AIIDE 2010 StarCraft Competition. Team \massexpand is born.

\paragraph{February 2010 - June 2010}
The Game Programming course is given at the University of Amsterdam and followed by both team members. A proposal to submit the bot as the final project for the course is accepted.

\paragraph{August 2010 - September 2010}
The first version of \massexpand is ready. The bot plays well but suffers from slowdowns and crashes.

\paragraph{September 2010 - October 2010}
The competition is held at UC Santa Cruz in California, USA. \massexpand participates in tournament 4 (complete games).

\paragraph{November 2010}
The results are posted online. \massexpand won the first round 1-3, but then lost 0-3 to the bot which would continue to win the tournament.

\paragraph{August 2011}
Work continues on a second version. The code is rewritten from scratch and uses the latest version of BWAPI, hoping to eliminate the slowdowns and crashes. This version will be submitted for the Game Programming course.

\paragraph{September 2011}
Finishing work on the bot and the documentation.
